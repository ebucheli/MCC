    "In this notebook we present an implementation of the Bees System Algorithm to find the solution to a 2-dimensional Sensor Network problem. First we implement several helper functions and finally we present an example problem statement and solution.\n",

    "Let us first talk about the characterization of the problem. The terrain is represented as a 2D grid with dimensions $6\\times 6$. We represent positions with a tuple $(a,b)$ where $a$ is the row and $b$ is the column. The upper left coordinate is $(1,1)$ and the bottom right corner is the coordinate $(6,6)$.\n",

    "The terrain or `board` is represented as a list that is itself composed of lists each containing the information for a row. In its original configuration, a $1$ represents a cell that we wish to have a sensor in and $0$ represents a cell which does not interests us. This changes when a solution is generated, this is explained later in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a list `sensors` whose length is equal to the number of sensors to place in the terrain. Each nth element `sensors[n]` represents the dimension of the receptive field of the sensor. So a sensor represented by the number $3$ has a receptive field of $3\\times 3$. The coordinate given is the upper left corner of said recpetive field.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution is represented as a list of tuples specifying the position for each sensor. This must coincide with the list `sensors`, so the first element in a list `sol` refers to the position of the first element in the `sensors` list, and so on."
